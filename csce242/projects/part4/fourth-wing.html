                    <p><strong>Book Title:</strong> Fourth Wing
                        <br><strong>Author:</strong> Rebecca Yarros
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Description:</strong> Twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant,
                        living a quiet life among books and history. Now, the commanding general — also
                        known as her tough-as-talons mother — has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of
                        candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre: dragon riders.
                    </p>
                    <p>But when you're smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is 
                        only a heartbeat away... because dragons don't bond to "fragile" humans. They incinerate
                        them.
                    </p>
                    <p>With fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their
                        own chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother's daughter — like
                        Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless windleader in the Riders Quadrant. 
                    </p>
                    <p>She'll need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise.
                    </p>
                    <p>Yet, with every day that passes, the war outside grows more deadly, the kingdom's
                        protective wards are failing, and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins
                        to suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret.
                    </p>
                    <p>Friends, enemies, lovers. Everyone at Basgiath War College has an agenda — because once you
                        enter, there are ony two ways out: <em>graduate or die</em> (rebeccayarros.com).
